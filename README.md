This repo contains the basic files and scripts necessary to set up a new robot for the **BYU Agricultural Robotics Team**. 
After flashing a new RPi 5, simply log into it over ssh, clone this repository, and run "setup.sh".
You should then be able to spin up the latest Docker image as a container using "compose.sh".

If you're looking to do remote development on the robot, check out these repos instead: https://github.com/BYUAgrobotics/AgrobotRPi.git, https://github.com/BYUAgrobotics/AgrobotTeensy.git
